# Perlin-Mapper
Perlin noise based procedural world generator in progress. As of now it has the ability to generate and visualize 3D perlin noise in both voxel form with matplotlib and by scrolling through each z level with pygame.

When using either perlin_3d_voxel or perlin_3d_pygame you are going to want to change the values below to adjust the noise.

Width, height and zlevel are the x, y, and z ranges. Lower zoom values or higher octaves values show more detail.
